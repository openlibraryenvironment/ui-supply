# Change history for ui-supply

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/openlibraryenvironment/ui-supply/tree/v1.0.0) (2020-08-24)

* Initial release, belatedly. This file didn't get created until 2020-09-29, but since a `v1.0.0` branch already exists on GitHub, it's most likely that this was done at the same time that all the `v1.0.0` tags were created for other ReShare modules, on 2020-08-24.
